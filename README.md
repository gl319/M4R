# M4R
These are code used in the development of the M4R research project, Spectral Embedding: Directed Random Dot Product Graph, by Guorui Luo.

There are four folders, corresponding to the examples, the simulated data, and the case studies on the two real-world data. Each file contains the data used as well as an R notebook with the codes to generate results and plots.
